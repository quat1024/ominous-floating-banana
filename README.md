Ominous Floating Banana
=======================

Tool to manage curseforge modpacks or something?

![high constrast banana (scary)](./crap/banana.jpg)

Uses CurseProxy https://curse.nikky.moe/ and interfaces with it using a super shitty graphql client i slapped together lol

Focuses on being pretty lightweight without much "fancy" things in the implementation.

## Building

It's not ready yet. note to self, make sure to run shadowJar not just "build"

### things to look in to

* Are there any "simple" graphql libs i can use, instead of my crappy handrolled one
* Look into proguard to shrink the size of output file
* Look into the "really executable .jar" thing lol
