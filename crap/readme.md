# Uhhh

Many of these files date to when this project was... way different from what it is now (i don't even know what i was trying to make, tbh). This is just assorted notes and analysis of what the curse api responds with

### crucial 2 manifest.json

The manifest.json from Crucial 2

### crucial 2 manifest SMALL.json

Same but I removed all but 3 of the files.

### curse response single mod.json

GET response from `https://addons-ecs.forgesvc.net/api/v2/addon/416471`. reformatted of course.

### curse response many mod.json

POST response from `https://addons-ecs.forgesvc.net/api/v2/addon/` with the POST body the contents of `crucial 2 manifest SMALL.json`. Basically an array of the same stuff seen in `single mod.json`
